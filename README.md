Fundamentals of Programming: II at the University of Victoria.<br/>
This course introduces abstract data types and recursion, object oriented programming, and efficiency of algorithms and data structures.
The topics include:
* A review of programming in Java
* The design, definition and manipulation of simple data objects
* The implementation of lists, including both sequential (linked) and random access (array) variations
* The implementation of stacks, queues, binary trees, and hash tables; with applications
* An introduction to polymorphism: class hierarchies, interfaces, and generic types
* Problem decomposition using recursion and divide-and-conquer strategies
* Techniques for describing the time and space requirements of data structures and their operations
* The efficiency of common searching and sorting approaches
